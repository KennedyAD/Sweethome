and the translations proposed by contributors at:

Note that some recent pieces of furniture might not be translated in your language.

Sweet Home 3D is configured to store user preferences and imported data in
the folder named "data", which lets you use the configuration of Sweet Home 3D 
from a computer to the other without reinstalling anything. The user must have 
write rights on this "data" folder to let the program save preferences and 
imported data. You can copy the content of the "data" folder from a device 
to another if you need to copy a configuration of Sweet Home 3D. 
Note also that this folder matches the configuration folder used by other
versions of Sweet Home 3D (installer or Java Web Start versions), i.e.:
- C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\eTeks\Sweet Home 3D 
  folder under Windows Vista / 7,
- C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\eTeks\Sweet Home 3D 
  folder under Windows XP and previous versions of Windows,
- Library/Application Support/eTeks/Sweet Home 3D
  sub folder of your user folder under Mac OS X, 
- .eteks/sweethome3d/furniture 
   sub folder of your user folder under Linux.   
If you need to restore the configuration of Sweet Home 3D you built with another 
version of Sweet Home 3D, you can copy the content of the previous folders to 
the "data" folder of the portable version (copying the subfolder named "work" is 
useless).

Plugins SH3P files are supported and should be placed in "data/plugins" sub folder.

CAUTION: DO NOT MOVE FILES FOUND IN FOLDERS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE NAMED "data"  
         OR SWEET HOME 3D MAY NOT WORK.
