The only part that's kind of rudimentary is the adjustable footrest -- everything else is as shown on different kayak models on the internet. Same with the rowboat.There's one thing with the rowboat that wants looking into if you plan to move the oars in either craft and that's the meshes that connect to the oars; they're not properly rigged so that the meshes move together correctly. Someone with more experience than I will have to work that out. The parts of the oarlock are, however, parented together in a way that I hope makes it easier to rig.All parts have intelligent names and the model is grouped and parented for easy appending or linking to your scene.</blockquote><hr /><h3>Help us moderate this file</h3><p>Blend Swap is a place to share and get awesome 3D work, if you think this blend falls into one of the following issues please file a report from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/92570">http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/92570</a> by clicking on the <strong>Manage</strong> panel to the left of the blend and then on <strong>Report/Flag</strong>:</p><ul><li>The blend author didn't make this blend and posted it as their own.</li><li>The blend author is violating a Creative Commons License or copyright.</li><li>The blend is incomplete, work in progress, or has missing textures.</li><li>The blend contains simulation cache files and other unneeded media.</li><li>The preview image has nothing to do with the blend's contents.</li></ul><p>Your help allows the site to stay clear of broken and stolen work.</p><hr /><h4>Notes:</h4><ul><li>Do NOT report this blend if you dont' know how to use a feature on Blender, instead use the <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/questions">questions section</a> of the site.</li></ul>    </article>    <footer>        Original file hosted by <a href="https://www.blendswap.com">Blend Swap, LLC</a>.    </footer></body></html>
