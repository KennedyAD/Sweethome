HOW TO USE THIS SOURCE CODE
---------------------------

JavaScript code of this project is compatible with HTML5 / WebGL, and the directory where
you find this README.TXT file contains all the information required to run the code.

Part of the JavaScript code required to run examples is generated from Sweet Home 3D Java code 
with JSweet transpiler available at http://www.jsweet.org
To generate the missing JavaScript code and run tests, install JDK 11 or more recent, 
Node version 14 available at https://nodejs.org/ and Ant available at http://ant.apache.org/ 
then run ant command in the directory where you uncompressed this archive followed 
by the "viewerLibraries" or "applicationLibraries" target names.
The "viewerLibraries" target will create missing JavaScript code in lib/generated 
for Sweet Home 3D JS Viewer and required to run the HTML files found in the test directory 
of this archive with any compatible browser (except for test/testHome.html). 
The "applicationLibraries" target will create missing JavaScript code in lib/generated 
for Sweet Home 3D JS Editor and required to run the test/testHome.html found  
in this archive with any compatible browser. 

The default target provided by build.xml Ant file concatenates .js files by license type, 
minifies them, and generates in install subdirectory a SweetHome3DJSViewer ZIP file 
that contains minified JavaScript code and HTML files you may use for your own web site. 

The main other target named "applicationBuild" provided by build.xml Ant file generates 
a web application .war file in install subdirectory, which you may deploy in a JSP server like Tomcat.
This web application will let you create and modify in a browser the home plan passed in the parameter 
"home" of index.jsp page. Changes in a home edited with in this application are automatically saved 
by the service in writeHomeEdits.jsp and read by the service readHome.jsp.
