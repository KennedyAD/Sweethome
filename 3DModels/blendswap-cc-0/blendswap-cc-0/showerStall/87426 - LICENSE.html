The doors have their origin at the proper pivot point.The model includes shower head, separate hand-held spray head, soap/shampoo rack, and grab bar. You'll find a bit of, uh, amateur topology on the spray head, a few ngons, but otherwise the model is pretty clean.The open source texture, the tile, is packed into the blend file. It originally comes from http://tiled-bg.blogspot.com/ , although I modified the size of the image, using multiples of the original to arrive at a higher resolution. The models are offered with no restrictions.</blockquote><hr /><h3>Help us moderate this file</h3><p>Blend Swap is a place to share and get awesome 3D work, if you think this blend falls into one of the following issues please file a report from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/87426">http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/87426</a> by clicking on the <strong>Manage</strong> panel to the left of the blend and then on <strong>Report/Flag</strong>:</p><ul><li>The blend author didn't make this blend and posted it as their own.</li><li>The blend author is violating a Creative Commons License or copyright.</li><li>The blend is incomplete, work in progress, or has missing textures.</li><li>The blend contains simulation cache files and other unneeded media.</li><li>The preview image has nothing to do with the blend's contents.</li></ul><p>Your help allows the site to stay clear of broken and stolen work.</p><hr /><h4>Notes:</h4><ul><li>Do NOT report this blend if you dont' know how to use a feature on Blender, instead use the <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/questions">questions section</a> of the site.</li></ul></article><footer>Original file hosted by <a href="http://www.blendswap.com">Blend Swap, LLC</a>.</footer></body></html>
